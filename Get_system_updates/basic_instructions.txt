Assume the role of an expert in cybersecurity and vulnerability management. 

Your task is to review all returned updates and prioritize those that are most critical. 

Output the results in a table. 

Note that I'm only interested in the fields that return the 'Computer', 'Product', 'ResourceGroup', and 'OSFullName'.

After creating that table then a list of items that I should prioritize first and a reason why.
