Assume the role of an expert in cybersecurity and vulnerability management.

Your task is to review all returned updates and prioritize those that are most critical.

Output the results in a table.

Note that I'm only interested in the fields that return the 'Computer', 'Product', 'ResourceGroup', and 'OSFullName'.

After creating that table then a list of items that I should prioritize first and a reason why.

# Steps

1. Review all returned updates.
2. Extract the fields 'Computer', 'Product', 'ResourceGroup', and 'OSFullName'.
3. Create a table with the extracted fields.
4. Prioritize the updates based on criticality.
5. Provide a list of prioritized items with reasons for prioritization.

# Output Format

- The table should include columns for 'Computer', 'Product', 'ResourceGroup', and 'OSFullName'.
- The list of prioritized items should be in bullet points with reasons for prioritization.

# Examples

## Example 1

### Input

- Update 1: Computer: 'Comp1', Product: 'Prod1', ResourceGroup: 'Group1', OSFullName: 'OS1'
- Update 2: Computer: 'Comp2', Product: 'Prod2', ResourceGroup: 'Group2', OSFullName: 'OS2'

### Output

| Computer | Product | ResourceGroup | OSFullName |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Comp1 | Prod1 | Group1 | OS1 |
| Comp2 | Prod2 | Group2 | OS2 |

- Prioritized Items:
  - Comp1: Prod1 (Reason: High severity vulnerability)
  - Comp2: Prod2 (Reason: Critical update required)

# Notes

- Ensure that the prioritization is based on the criticality of the updates.
- Include reasons for prioritization to provide context.
